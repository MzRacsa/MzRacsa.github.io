The reason why i chose to do my capstone project on Fairy tales first of all is because I realized that growing up, fairy tales have been a part in my upbringing and my values. I grew up on watching Disney movies and listening to their morals and their values. I too wanted to be a princess growing up and I wanted to be treated as a princess as well. But with that mindset, i realized that I also grew up naive and thought a true love’s kiss was special, but in all actuality, it’s creepy. I didn’t know this until I took a class called Fairy Tales and Adaptations and the first stories we read were the adaptations of Little Red RIding Hood. 

I chose Little Red RIding Hood as my forefront of my capstone project out of all the other projects is because it was the project that made the most sense. LRRH for short has many adaptations and many morals behind them. Since I wanted to do a Choose Your Adventure style book, LRRH was a perfect story to use. Of course, I couldn’t just use what Grimm or Perrault wrote, I had to make this my own. I wanted Red to be smarter, reliant, and I wanted her to have more agency. 

Therefore, the purpose of this project is to challenge the themes of old classic fairy tales such as mysogyny and objectification. I also want to bring upon the idea of agency where in almost all classic fairy tales, the girl protagonist does not have any choice.
